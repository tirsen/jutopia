Today is my last day at Google.

I joined Google about 3 years ago and most of that time I worked as one of the tech leads of Google Wave. It was a crazy but exciting time. We went from being the most hyped product on the web to, well, shall we say slightly ridiculed. Then we were cancelled...

In my new startup (see below) we've been using Wave for most of our communication. We've trying to find something to replace it with it but we keep on coming back. Nothing lets us do the same level of fluid open collaborations. I actually think Wave is a great product that just didn't have the right marketing message. Someone really should step up and provide a real alternative. Skip "replace email" and all the complexity that comes from that and focus on the fluid user interface and just charge for it. We would pay.

Anyway, I digress. After Wave I worked for a little while on the Maps API until our 20% project [Shared Spaces](http://sharedspaces.googlelabs.com) took off and became my 100% project. It was fun for a little while and I got to learn Python, the inner workings of AppEngine and the finer details of cross-domain communication in the browser.

Me and [Douwe](http://blog.douweosinga.com/) had been playing around with this idea for a start up for a little while and we felt it was probably as good a time as any to have a go at it. Together with Douwe's two brothers we're starting [Triposo](http://www.triposo.com). We're building travel guides for mobile phones. We crawl open content on the web, merge, score and generally massage it in a pipeline (running on our rather beefy workstations under our desks at home currently) then publish it to iPad, iPhone and Android (Windows Phone 7 to come). Here is for example our Barcelona guide in the [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcelona-travel-guide-by/id430531579?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) and in the [Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.triposo.droidguide.barcelona). They're not bad actually and we've barely started!

I'm also doing another start up. My son Samir was born last friday so here's the mandatory new-parent gratuitous baby shot:
