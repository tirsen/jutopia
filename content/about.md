# About me

My name is Jon Tirs&eacute;n. I'm an Australian/Swedish Software Engineer currently living in Balmain in Sydney.

I'm currently working on a start up called [Triposo][http://triposo.com]. We build travel guides for mobile phone. I've previously worked on [Google][http://www.google.com] and [ThoughtWorks][http://www.thoughtworks.com] and a bunch of smaller places you probably don't know about.
