# About me

My name is Jon Tirs&eacute;n. I'm an Australian/Swedish Software Engineer currently living in Balmain in Sydney.

I'm currently working on a start up called [Triposo](http://triposo.com). We build travel guides for mobile phones. I've previously worked at [Google](http://www.google.com) and [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com) and a bunch of smaller places you probably don't know about.
